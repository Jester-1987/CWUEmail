# CWUEmail

These are the email templates for CareWithU.

The files have been organized by reciever. If a file name starts with either caregiver or careseeker, that's who the email should be sent to. The only exception is the "both_parties" folder as those emails are (as the name suggests) meant for both caregivers and careseekers.

Each folder also contains a folder named "img" which contains all relevant images used by the templates within the parent folder. It will need to be uploaded to the email server along with each of the templates. If the images and templates need to be in the same folder when uploaded to the email server, then "img/" should be removed from all image file paths in the code.

All of the **TODO:** items currently in the code also need to be addressed prior to all the emails going live as these templates were written when the site was mostly in the prototype stage.
